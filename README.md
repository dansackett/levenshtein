# Damerau–Levenshtein Distance

This repository implements a [Damerau–Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance) in Go.
The implementation was mostly for learning the algorithm while also practicing Go again.

More coming soon on what this actually is...
